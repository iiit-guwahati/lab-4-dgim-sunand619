    "The DGIM algorithm is used to count the number of \"True\" (1) present in a stream of 1/0 considering only the last N elements. N elements essentially constitute the sliding window. The implementation is done using a compact data structure that consumes $O(log^2(N))$ space. Explanation can be found in Chapter 4 of the book."
